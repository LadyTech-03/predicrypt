### Local Development

1. Clone the repository
```bash
cd predicrypt
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run a local Sui network
```bash
git clone --branch devnet https://github.com/MystenLabs/sui.git
cd sui
RUST_LOG="off,sui_node=info" cargo run --bin sui-test-validator
```

4. Get localnet SUI tokens
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:9123/gas' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```
Replace `<ADDRESS>` with your active Sui address.

### Deploy Smart Contract

1. Navigate to the contract directory
```bash
cd prediction-market-contract
cd prediction-market
```

2. Build the contract
```bash
sui move build
```

3. Deploy to the network
```bash
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000
```

4. Update the `.env` file with your contract address
```env
REACT_APP_PACKAGE_ID=<your_package_id>
```

### Run the Application

1. Start the development server
```bash
npm start
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Authentication Flow

The application uses zkLogin for secure authentication. The flow is handled by `authService.ts` and includes:
1. Google OAuth authentication
2. zkLogin proof generation
3. Secure wallet creation
4. Transaction signing

More details about the zkLogin flow can be found here: https://docs.sui.io/concepts/cryptography/zklogin
